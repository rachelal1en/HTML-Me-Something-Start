               in my chest like a heartbeat. The walls in the basement were wet with sweat, the crowd was packed in so
               tight, and we were all there to embrace the volume and anger in punk music. I was very blessed to find
               Bad Beaver as an outlet when I needed it.

            <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">Wandering through Paris and exploring the different pockets of music was
               electric. It was right next to the Eiffel Tower where we decided to stop and observe. We learned from
               fellow festival goers how to pop out a wine cork with an elbow. We joined in the crowd near the speakers
               to celebrate and dance. When the opening chords of Seven Nation Army by the White Stripes played the
               crowd went wild and so did I. The oneness with the crowd was a religious experience.

               essentially spoken-word in some of their songs. I was very into spoken-word at the time (and am still).
               The depth of feeling in their words deeply moved me and I still look back upon as something I really
               needed at that time.

            <p class="funParagraph">The Firebird was my favorite venue in St. Louis and I truly believe the city is
               worse for no longer having it. It was hard to pick which of the shows I saw there was my favorite but
               Yeasayer tops the list. The strong musical backing that complements the lyrics pound through the crowd
               like a heartbeat.

            <p class="funParagraph">My friend Kayla was in town from medical school with her friend Cat. While they were
               out at the Crack Fox, they met the drummer from Third Eye Blind and got VIP tickets for the 3 of us to
               their performance as well as his number. We have very few pictures from that night because we were late
               and
               will call was closed by the time we arrived. My friend from middle school Stephanie was working the gate
               and I was able to talk her into letting us in anyway. So, we made it in but obviously didn't know where
               our seats in VIP were supposed to be nor had proof we were even allowed in that section. We hung out in
               the aisles for the end of the performance and then texted him that we were here but didn't know where to
               go for the after party. He told us where to go and told security to let us in and it was us and a few
               other girls on blow-up couches with a cooler of beer. It was such an odd but fun and interesting night.
               We hung out with them all night until like 2am when their tour bus was leaving to take-off to their next
               destination. All the gates were closed so we had to wander around to try to get out and then also try to
               escape the parking lot with closed gates. It was a crazy night.</p>

            <p class="funParagraph">My mom is a member of the St. Louis Science Center and pays attention to their events
               to utilize it. When she saw laser shows based upon music advertised to take place in the Planetarium last
               year, I wasn't sure what to expect. She and I attended "Laser Zepplin" which was okay but afterward I
               knew it would be phenomenal with Fleetwood Mac's discography. It was a transcendent experience to be
               laying on the ground (we brought pillows and blankets) and being completely immersed in the music while
               watching the lasers on the curved ceiling. I jumped at the opportunity to attend again this year with
               more of my friends, I would recommend more people to attend but there are so few Fleetwood Mac themed
               shows and I don't want the tickets to become even harder to get.</p>

            <p class="funParagraph">I, unfortunately, was not able to get tickets to see The Eras Tour live. I am very
               grateful for the people that livestream them while they are there and for Tess on TikTok who assembles
               them to be a mostly continuous stream. Also, seeing the tour in the movie theater production was a lot of
               fun since it has the theater sound system. I have enjoyed watching to see what kind of Suprise
               songs/mashups occur and being a part of the community that celebrates and theorizes about the
               performances.</p>

            <p class="funParagraph">I have seen Bleachers in concert many times but this was my first experience.
               The performance the band puts go and the stagecraft Jack employs makes for a fabulous night.
               It was so moving to be apart of the sea of emotions brought on by their songs.

            <p class="funParagraph">I have seem Taking Back Sunday many times live. The Ready Room was the smallest venue I ever had the
               chance to see them though.
               Being crowded in a small space with sticky-floors only condensed the feeling outpouring from the crowd.

               was this performance.
               I had loved and followed them both for so long and I attended with someone just as passoniate about them
               as me.
               Them coming onstage to play together was beyond what I could have hoped for.
